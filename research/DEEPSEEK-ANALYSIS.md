# DeepSeek Mathematical Analysis

## Formal Proofs (deepseek-chat, temperature=0.1)

### Theorem 1: INT8 Soundness (PROVEN)

For any v, lo, hi ∈ [-127, 127] where lo ≤ hi:
int8_comparison(v, lo, hi) = int32_comparison(v, lo, hi)

**Proof:** The int8 cast is the identity function on [-127, 127] (Lemma: for x ∈ [-127, 127], f(x) = ((x+128) mod 256) - 128 = x). Since the cast preserves all values, the comparison is identical.

**Corollary:** Our 8.3M exhaustive Python test was unnecessary — the soundness follows from elementary arithmetic. But the test provides empirical confirmation.

### Theorem 2: XOR Dual-Path Equivalence (PROVEN)

For any signed 32-bit integers v, lo, hi:
(v ≥ lo AND v ≤ hi) ⟺ ((v ⊕ 0x80000000) ≥_u (lo ⊕ 0x80000000) AND (v ⊕ 0x80000000) ≤_u (hi ⊕ 0x80000000))

**Proof:** XOR with 0x80000000 = adding 2³¹ (mod 2³²). This is a strictly increasing bijection from signed to unsigned order (Lemma 3). Adding a constant preserves ≤, so signed comparison maps to unsigned comparison.

**This proves the XOR fix is correct for ALL INT32 values**, not just the ones we tested.

## Beam-Intent Equivalence (CRITICAL CORRECTION)

DeepSeek's mathematical critique **demolishes** the beam-intent equivalence claim:

| Aspect | Beam Equilibrium | Intent Alignment | Same? |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Base space | Graph (1D simplicial complex) | Discrete 9-point set | ❌ Different |
| Stalks | ℝ⁴ (vector space) | [0,1] (interval) | ❌ Different |
| Constraints | Linear equalities | Inequalities | ❌ Different |
| Deflection sum | Linear (δ = Σδᵢ) | RSS (ε = √Σεᵢ²) | ❌ Not analogous |
| Stiffness→tolerance | No direct mapping | Metaphor only | ❌ Not rigorous |

**Verdict:** The equivalence is a **superficial analogy**, not a mathematical identity. Both can be phrased as "find H⁰ ≠ ∅" but the sheaves, base spaces, stalks, and consistency conditions are fundamentally different. The RSS tolerance formula is statistical, not physical. Beam deflection is additive, not Euclidean.

**Action:** Remove the beam-intent equivalence from the paper. Keep it as a motivational metaphor in the research docs, but don't present it as mathematically rigorous.

## Optimal Threshold Derivation (4 frameworks)

### Framework 1: Information-Theoretic
Maximize bits/cycle per register-bit. Crossing points:
- INT8 → INT16: s = **0.178**
- INT16 → INT32: s = **0.378**
- INT32 → DUAL: s = **0.607**

### Framework 2: Decision-Theoretic (safety-weighted, C_downgrade=10, C_upgrade=1)
- INT8 → INT16: s = **0.136**
- INT16 → INT32: s = **0.273**
- INT32 → DUAL: s = **0.545**

### Framework 3: Throughput-Maximizing (ε=0, strict safety)
- INT8 → INT16: s = **0.125** (= 8/64)
- INT16 → INT32: s = **0.250** (= 16/64)
- INT32 → DUAL: s = **0.500** (= 32/64)

### Framework 4: Our Current (Arbitrary)
- INT8 → INT16: s = **0.25**
- INT16 → INT32: s = **0.50**
- INT32 → DUAL: s = **0.75**

**Analysis:** Our thresholds are suboptimal in all frameworks:
- Too conservative on INT8 (0.25 vs 0.125-0.178) → fewer INT8 constraints → less speedup
- Too conservative on DUAL (0.75 vs 0.500-0.607) → fewer DUAL → less safety

The information-theoretic thresholds (0.178/0.378/0.607) maximize throughput per register-bit.
The safety-weighted thresholds (0.136/0.273/0.545) add a safety margin.

**Recommendation:** Use safety-weighted thresholds (0.15/0.30/0.55 rounded) for the next version.

## Impact on Published Numbers

With optimal thresholds (0.15/0.30/0.55), the AV mix changes:
- Before: 75% INT8, 15% INT16, 8% INT32, 2% DUAL (arbitrary)
- After: ~85% INT8, ~10% INT16, ~4% INT32, ~1% DUAL (information-theoretic)

Expected throughput gain: **3.5-4.0x** (more INT8, less DUAL overhead)
This needs experimental verification.

## Key Takeaway

DeepSeek provided three critical contributions:
1. **Formal proofs** of INT8 soundness and XOR equivalence (Theorems 1 & 2)
2. **Mathematical debunking** of the beam-intent equivalence (preventing a wrong claim in the paper)
3. **Optimal threshold derivation** from 4 frameworks (our thresholds were suboptimal)

The proofs mean we can ship with mathematical confidence. The debunking prevents an embarrassing error. The threshold optimization gives us a clear path to better performance.
